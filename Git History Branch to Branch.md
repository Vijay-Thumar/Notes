If `git diff client/develop` isn't showing any changes, but your PR still shows 46 file changes, the issue is likely due to **commit history divergence** rather than actual file differences.

### **Steps to Fix the PR Showing Extra Changes**

#### âœ… **Step 1: Check Commit History**

Run this command to compare commit history:
``` 
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all 
```
If you see different commit hashes between `vijay/develop` and `client/develop`, Git considers them separate, even if the content is identical.

#### âœ… **Step 2: Hard Reset Your `vijay/develop` to Match `client/develop`**

Since there are no file differences (`git diff` shows nothing), forcefully align both branches:
`
```
git checkout develop
git fetch client develop
git reset --hard client/develop  # Make vijay/develop identical to client/develop
git push origin develop --force  # Force update remote vijay/develop
```

	**Warning:** This removes any local uncommitted changes, so ensure you donâ€™t lose important work

#### âœ… **Step 3: Verify PR Again**

1. Go back to your PR in GitHub.
2. Check if the extra file changes are gone.
3. If they persist, delete and recreate the PR.

#### **Why Did This Happen?**

Even though the code was identical, the **commit history** wasnâ€™t. This happens if:

- Someone force-pushed to `client/develop`.
- Your branch was merged instead of rebased.
- Your PR includes old commits that should have been excluded.

After resetting, your `vijay/develop` will match `client/develop` exactly, and your PR should no longer show extra file changes.
